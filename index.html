				<h2>Jayson Kurfis</h2>
				<p>Jayson Kurfis holds a masters' and bachelors' degree in biology.  Jayson's publication history includes a number of peer reviewed scientific articles.  His initial research articles focused on G protein coupled receptors, GPCRs, and their implication in cancer, subsequently worked on isolating proteins that lead to acute renal failure.</p> <br/>
				<p>Through the use of a 3-dimensional skin model derived from human tissue, Jayson was able to test a number of products for their potential to cause irritation through an evaluation of inflammatory cytokines.  In addition, this afforded the ability to test a number of raw materials to see if these chemicals would lead to a reduction in irritation.  As curiosity grew, he started scouting for potential materials that could abrogate skin irritation and be coded in to the L'Oreal system for usable chemicals. </p> <br/>  
				<p>Jayson's goal then became understanding how information observed on the 3-dimensional skin model translated to human experiences.  Jayson was able to demonstrate that there were some common inflammatory mediators that were released in both the 3D model and with skin samples taken before and after product use from volunteers.  By working with L'Oreal's formulation chemistry and safety teams, Jayson was able to test a number of raw materials on these volunteers using a simplex formulation that could be used to abrogate the inflammatory skin response. </p> <br/>
				<p>While at MilliporeSigma, Jayson shifted in to marketing.  The work focused on a number of product lines that are used in almost every biochem and molecular biology lab.  Jayson developed the business plan for a product line targeted to the diagnostic and pharmaceutical markets and helped customers find the best product to suit their specific needs. </p> <br/>
				<p>Jayson advocated for SE Wisconsin biotech by writing articles for a Chicago-based VC firm.  These articles included a write-up about the health innovation pitch (HIP) event, investable technology that was being developed at Blood Center and a description of a company that is focused on developing new treatments for ovarian and lung cancer.</p>
